# hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance

## What does this package do

This package is an **impedance control demo** for the Maver X4 and Trigger A
chassis that works in **both ROS 1 and ROS 2**.

The node first drives the steering joints to a stable configuration, records the current base pose as the equilibrium, then switches into SE(2) impedance control: at every control cycle it reads `/chs_state`, limits the planar pose error toward the equilibrium, maps the body-frame error to a twist command, and publishes a `VEL` control command on `/chs_ctrl`. The robot driver (or the [`hex_ros_sim_maver_x4`](../hex_ros_sim_maver_x4) simulator) tracks that twist through chassis inverse kinematics, so the base compliantly returns toward the equilibrium pose when disturbed.

A keyboard interface (see [`hex_ros_teleop_keyboard`](../hex_ros_teleop_keyboard)) is used for runtime control:

* press **`q`** to stop the demo and settle the chassis back to the stable joint configuration.

Data recording is left to ROS's built-in bag tools (`ros2 bag record` / `rosbag record`).

## Getting Started

1. Install necessary dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip3 install 'hex-util-msg>=0.1.0a0'
   pip3 install 'hex-util-ros>=0.0.1a0'
   ```

2. Create a workspace and navigate to the `src` directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
   cd catkin_ws/src
   ```

3. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/hexfellow/hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance.git
   ```

4. Navigate back and build the workspace:

   For ROS 1:

   ```shell
   cd ../
   catkin_make
   ```

   For ROS 2:

   ```shell
   cd ../
   colcon build
   ```

5. Source the `setup.bash` file:

   For ROS 1:

   ```shell
   source devel/setup.bash --extend
   ```

   For ROS 2:

   ```shell
   source install/setup.bash --extend
   ```

### Usage


For a real robot, edit the following arguments in the selected launch file before launching.

ROS 1 (`launch/ros1/real_impedance_maver_x4.launch` or `real_impedance_trigger_a.launch`):

```xml
<arg name="robot_host" default="192.168.1.100"/>
<arg name="robot_port" default="8439"/>
```

ROS 2 (`launch/ros2/real_impedance_maver_x4.launch.py` or `real_impedance_trigger_a.launch.py`):

```python
robot_host_arg = DeclareLaunchArgument(
    name='robot_host',
    default_value='192.168.1.100')
robot_port_arg = DeclareLaunchArgument(
    name='robot_port',
    default_value='8439')
```

launch (real robot + keyboard + impedance):

```bash
ros2 launch hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance real_impedance_maver_x4.launch.py
```


One-shot bringup (simulation + keyboard + impedance):

```shell
ros2 launch hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance sim_impedance_maver_x4.launch.py
```

For Trigger A:

```shell
ros2 launch hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance sim_impedance_trigger_a.launch.py
```

Or start the pieces separately:

1. Start a chassis state/control source (e.g. the simulator) and the keyboard node:

   For ROS 2:

   ```shell
   ros2 launch hex_ros_sim_maver_x4 sim_maver_x4.launch.py
   ros2 launch hex_ros_teleop_keyboard teleop_keyboard.launch.py
   ```

2. Launch the `chassis_impedance` node:

   For ROS 1:

   ```shell
   roslaunch hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance chassis_impedance_maver_x4.launch
   ```

   For ROS 2:

   ```shell
   ros2 launch hex_ros_demo_chassis_impedance chassis_impedance_maver_x4.launch.py
   ```

   Replace the `maver_x4` suffix with `trigger_a` to use the Trigger A launch files.

3. The chassis settles to the stable joint pose, records the equilibrium, then enters impedance control. Push the base in the MuJoCo viewer to feel the restoring behavior. Press `q` to exit. To record data, use ROS's bag tools, for example:

   ```shell
   rosbag record -a    # ROS 1
   ros2 bag record -a  # ROS 2
   ```
